## <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Teaching Philosophy

I view teaching as a process of helping students develop **strong conceptual foundations** and connect those concepts to **real engineering systems**. Understanding, rather than memorization, forms the basis of meaningful learning. When students grasp underlying principles, they are better prepared to apply their knowledge across different contexts, technologies, and problem domains.

My role as an instructor is that of a **facilitator of learning**, encouraging questioning, discussion, and reflection. Classrooms should be spaces where students feel comfortable exploring ideas, making mistakes, and refining their understanding through feedback and interaction.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Learning and Instructional Approach

My courses combine **structured lectures** with **discussion and problem-solving activities**. Topics are typically introduced through physical interpretation or practical relevance before moving to formal analytical treatment. This approach helps students understand both the motivation behind a concept and the methodology used to analyze it.

<i class="fa-solid fa-diagram-project"></i> Worked examples and alternative solution strategies are discussed to highlight multiple ways of approaching a problem.  
<i class="fa-solid fa-computer"></i> Simulation tools are used where appropriate to support visualization and verification of analytical results, with emphasis placed on interpretation rather than tool usage alone.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-bullseye"></i> Teaching Objectives

Through my teaching, I aim to help students:

- <i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> Develop strong conceptual understanding of engineering fundamentals  
- <i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i> Connect theory with real-world engineering applications  
- <i class="fa-solid fa-calculator"></i> Build confidence in analytical and problem-solving skills  
- <i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> Cultivate independent and reflective learning habits  

Ultimately, my goal is to prepare students to engage thoughtfully and effectively with evolving engineering challenges.
