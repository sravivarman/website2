> [!note] <strong>Research & Student Projects</strong>
 > My research and project activities focus on **power electronics**, **renewable energy systems**, **electric vehicles**, and **intelligent energy management**, with an emphasis on practical engineering challenges and technologies relevant to current and emerging industry needs. <br><br>
 I actively work with undergraduate and postgraduate students in a **collaborative lab environment** that reflects real engineering practice. Students are encouraged to take ownership of the complete development process, including **problem formulation**, **analytical reasoning**, **simulation studies**, **control strategy development**, and **experimental implementation**. Projects typically progress from conceptual ideas to functional prototypes, allowing students to engage with design trade-offs, system integration challenges, and practical constraints.<br><br>
 Through this structured yet flexible approach, I aim to foster strong technical depth, independent thinking, and effective teamwork. The collaborative lab culture helps students **translate theoretical concepts into working solutions** and prepares them to contribute meaningfully in industrial and applied research settings.
