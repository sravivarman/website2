## About Me

> The more I learn, the more I realize how much remains unknown — and that is precisely what makes the journey meaningful.

I am **S. Ravivarman**, an academic and practitioner with interests spanning **electrical engineering, electric mobility, power electronics, and emerging technologies**.  
This website serves as a personal space to document ideas, research directions, teaching materials, and reflections gathered along the way.

My work is driven by curiosity, clarity of fundamentals, and the desire to build solutions that are **technically sound and socially relevant**.

**At a glance:**
- 👨‍🏫 Faculty / Researcher in Electrical & Electronics Engineering  
- ⚡ Focus areas: Electric Vehicles, Motor Drives, Power Electronics, Energy Systems  
- 🧪 Interested in indigenous technology development and applied research  
- ✍️ Writing to document learning, not to showcase perfection
